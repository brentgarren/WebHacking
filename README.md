Step 1: Explore the website listing exploring the website and noting down the individual pages/areas/features with a summary for each one.
<br><br>
Step 2: View the page source from each area checking for comments or hidden links Shortcut="Ctrl-U". Putting the URL in this form will also in most cases show you the page source "view-source:https[://]www[.]google[.]com/"
